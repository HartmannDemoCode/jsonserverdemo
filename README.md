# My Json Server Demo
[source](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/)
## How to use
The file: create.js is used with cli: `node create.js > db.json`. 
The created file db.json is read by my-json-server, in a way that the dummy data will be available now at: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/HartmannDemoCode/jsonserverdemo/books

## Caveats
We can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests BUT changes are NOT peristed. If this is important, then use local jsonserver.
